            value: "Monstera deliciosa, the Swiss cheese plant, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical forests of southern Mexico, south to Panama. It has been introduced to many tropical areas, and has become a mildly invasive species in Hawaii, Seychelles, Ascension Island and the Society Islands. It is very widely grown in temperate zones as a houseplant.\nThe plant may be confused with Thaumatophyllum bipinnatifidum, known as the Split-leaf Philodendron or Tree Philodendron, as they have similar leaves and growing habits. However, the ingestion of Thaumatophyllum bipinnatifidum may cause irritation to the digestive tract and will induce internal swelling. The sap is also known to irritate the skin.",
